1. In our synthetic data construction, we want to be able to stress test the faithfulness mechanism as this is the most important part of the entire project. However, we want to be able to massively vary the difficulty by being able to generate various different types of synthetic data. Especially as an initial testing baseline, we want something very basic

2. We should treat relations in the same way as they are treated in the relbench data. I'm not certain how this is done. It might be useful to include directed and undirected information for optionality

3. we should defer atomic paths as a potential future extension

4. yes, a trend is exactly the concept unit I define in the strategy.pdf

5. by multiple trends, I mean that all of the interpretations that you provide, with the critical point that we should be able to toggle and test each of these data qualities to understand mode failures of the faithfulness mechanism

6. At the early stage of faithfulness mechanism testing, we can ignore the actual label. We just want to be able to identify whether the evidence scores for the trends match expectation given the amount of noise we apply to paths meant to represent evidence for trend/concept existence

7. yes, timestamps are only attached to nodes

8. we should allow any delta vector (at least currently)

9. I wish to conform to whatever time value is used in the relbench data. But, critically, as long as the units intra-data are consistent, they can be arbitrary in scale

10. this should be a vector per hop, representing a latent feature representation

11. I am assuming that the latent space will implicitly be segmented by node type, using a geometric style interpretation of the latent space, nodes from the same table should be closer to one another in the embedding space

12. When generating noise for the data, we should be able to flip relations if we want, but critically all of this information should be toggleable and tuneable via a config.

13. For the initial purposes of allowing the faithfulness/ evidence mechanism to determine whether metapaths in the input graph exist, 

14. As I have stated, at this point we ignore node label. We are only looking to test the expressiveness of the proposed evidencing mechanism
